							<h2>Abstract</h2>
							<p align=" justify"> The notion of Cyber-Physical-Social system (CPSS) is an emerging concept developed as a
								result of the need to understand the impact of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) on humans and
								vice versa. The concept of CPSS has been around for over a decade now, and it has gained
								increasing attention over the past few years. Nevertheless, its conceptualisation has always been
								use-case dependent and there is no generic view as most works focus on specific domains of
								application. Despite the notion that CPSS is still in its infancy, the evolution to incorporate
								human aspects in the CPS research has unlocked many research challenges. CPSS environments
								are often regarded as physical and virtual places of interaction that humans and sensor-enabled
								smart devices cohabitate. Thus, the social aspect is tightly coined with the presence of a human
								in the vicinity of the so-called smart devices either serving as a source of information or consuming
								a service. The prominent aim of this paradigm shift is to ultimately ensure a seamless human-machine interaction experience. Hence, the newly introduced social part largely resides in how
								machines perceive and respond to humans’ interaction responses. This constitutes complex
								emotional, cognitive and behavioural facets. However, none of the existing works provides a
								comprehensive representation of such aspects.</p>
							<p align ="justify"> It is also evident that the evolution towards
								a more and more pervasiveness of technology is gradually increasing the complexity of CPSS
								environments. Especially since the rationale behind the CPSS paradigm is to bring humans to
								the centre of the interaction experience, system designs should carefully address various aspects
								of social dynamics. Nevertheless, ensuring a seamless experience in such a context is not a
								trivial task. Particularly because it is often a subjective experience that is largely influenced
								by individual preferences, interests, needs and capabilities varying from one person to another.
								This plays a crucial role in determining users’ quality of experience. Additionally, the actions
								and behaviours of people within a CPSS are also reflections of their unique personalities shaped
								over time through personal experiences, knowledge, and different environmental factors that are
								not yet fully understood. Therefore, recognising personal preferences, interests, limitations and
								opportunities of individuals become one of the necessities to ensure a seamless interaction within
								a CPSS. This positions the notion of personalisation at the heart of the CPSS paradigm. In this
								context the objective of the thesis is primarily to provide a theoretical contribution in formalising
								the concept of CPSS, thereby establishing a domain-independent understanding of the paradigm.
								Subsequently, to propose a novel personalisation approach in the context of CPSS by taking into
								account the overall systemic complexities which is not the case of current approaches. Finally, to
								demonstrate the proposed approach by designing personalisation algorithms for selected case studies and experimentally validate the feasibility. </p>

									<h2>Chapter 1: Literature Survey</h2>
									<p  align ="justify">In this chapter, we begin with a detailed overview of Cyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS)
										through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The SLR explores the different definitions of
										CPSS, its application areas and how the social aspect is conceptualised in literature. This will
										lead us to discuss the open challenges and opportunities in the CPSS paradigm, particularly in
										terms of integrating the social aspect with the existing notion of Cyber-Physical System (CPS).
										Following this, we justify the need for a systemic formalisation of the CPSS paradigm as a central
										unifying criterion. Subsequently, we discuss the role of personality as one of the social dimensions
										and its enormous impact on the interaction experience of users in a CPSS. Hence, we position
										the contribution of the thesis based on these findings. </p>

									<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
									<p  align ="justify">In this chapter, we present the main contributions of this thesis. Primarily, we propose a formalisation to the notion of CPSS which captures the existing conceptualisation in literature and
										projects a view for the future developments of the paradigm. The formalisation mainly constitutes a generic definition of CPSS and a meta-model proposal. This offers a domain independent
										understanding of the concept. Secondly, we introduce the concept of personalisation to the domain of CPSS as one feasible solution to support the integration of social aspects in the CPSS
										paradigm. Particularly, we proposed a novel problem formulation strategy that can be used to
										implement personalisation in different domains of CPSS. <br>

							<h2>Chapter 3: Case Studies</h2>
							<p align ="justify">In this chapter, we present two independent case studies, which instantiate the CPSS meta-model and
								the CPSS-specific personalisation method proposed in chapter 2. These case studies
								illustrate the domain-independent characteristic of our approach. The first case study concerns
								personalised recommendation and guidance in smart exhibition areas, whereas the second one
								is about adaptation of collaborative robots (Cobots) in a smart workshop setting. Framing
								their respective scenarios on the basis of CPSS, each of the case studies resort to different
								implementation techniques to fulfil their personalisation objective, fitting to their specific context.
								After presenting the approaches we finalise each case study by discussing experimental results.
								Finally we close the chapter by summarising the takeaways from the two case studies.

										CPSS. In this chapter, we revisit the key research problems, the state-of-the-art limitations as well
