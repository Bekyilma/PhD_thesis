									<h2>A Metamodel Proposal</h2>
									<p>As a first step towards a Smart Assessment Framework,
										we devised a metamodel with the elements
										of a Smart Assessment and their relationships.
										The work was presented in the 14th OTM/IFAC/IFIP International Workshop on
										Enterprise Integration, Interoperability and Networking (<a href="http://www.otmconferences.org/index.php/workshops/ei2n-2019" target="_blank">EI2N 2019</a>).</p>

									<h2>Characterising Smart Systems</h2>
									<p> The idea of the Smart Assessment is based on the use systems with smart capabilities to support assessments in enterprises. Therefore, understanding what makes a system smart is relevant to guide the development of such systems. Our work, published in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166361520300270" target="_blank">Computers in Industry journal</a>, presented a Systematic Literature Review followed by a Text Mining approach to analyse definitions of smart systems in the scientific literature with the objective to provide a description of the most common characteristics of smart systems.

									<h2>The Smart Assessment Framework</h2>
									<p> A conceptual framework devised to guide the development of smarter assessment approaches based on the integration of capabilities from smart systems to carry out the assessment process has been proposed in the <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/" target="_blank">21st IFAC World Congress</a> in 2020. The framework was defined through a conceptual model described using the ArchiMate modelling language. The model links Motivation, Business and Application elements that are present in the Smart Assessment scope.
